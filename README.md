[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andre-d/JSMESS_Loader.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andre-d/JSMESS_Loader)

## Example

TBD

## Development

In order to contribute, you will need to install:
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  This is a JavaScript interpreter similar to
`python` or `ruby` that is used to execute the various tooling.

**Note if you install with something like Homebrew or Aptitude, you may need
to install [NPM](http://npmjs.org/) separately.**

Once you have installed the above, simply run `npm install` inside the project
directory.

### Tests

Unit tests can be invoked from the command line via:

``` bash
npm test
```

### Documentation

At the moment there are no pubished resources for API documentation, but fear
not, you can generate the API documentation by running:

``` bash
npm run jsdoc
```

Once that completes you can open **docs/index.html** in your browser.
